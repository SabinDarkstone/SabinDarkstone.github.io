> [!QUOTE] Prompt: What went well for you this week?

Especially compared to the last few weeks, work went extremely well for me this week. It was far less intense and stressful than it has been and I've been able to feel like I'm a successful developer again.

Kevin gave me a task to develop a tool for the sales team to use in Salesforce, as requested by the managing partner, Scott. I was able to give Kevin a proof of concept in a few hours and finish a first version in anofher few hours. Kevin's really excited to see the progress I've made and I think that this has really sold my value to him if I hadn't done that already. More importantly, I think it will sell my value to Scott and the rest of leadership.

I'm feeling optimistic about work again and happy with myself. I've had free time during the workday to play games or watch YouTube, I haven't had to work late or long days, and I've been able to wrap up the work day feeling positive and happy instead of burned out.

I really hope things continue this way with the Bestpass configuration work!
