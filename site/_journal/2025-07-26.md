While the work week has been rather nice, my personal life has been a bit hectic this week, and especially these last two days.  I'm at the point today where I don't really know how I should feel because all the emotions are bubbling around in a chaotic brew.  So, here's another installment of journaling on the treadmill, but this time I have the music I'm listening to listed at the top.
## Mid-Week News
I can't even remember the exact day at this point because so much is swirling around in my head.  What do I remember is my partner messaging me that her best friend had called her without heads up or warning to ask if she should come over for a bit to talk.  I, simultaneously, got some messages on telegram asking the same thing from the best friend, but I didn't get notifications due to my phone being set up to block notifications while I'm on the treadmill.

My partner and I coordinated and despite me having a meeting scheduled at the same time as the best friend coming over, I said no problem.  To make a long story short, I got out of the meeting and sat down at the kitchen table to find out that a close friend, we'll call him J, was found dead in his home from suicide.  This wasn't the news my partner nor I were expecting and even though I didn't know him very well, I was crushed but went into tactical emotional support pup mode.

The rest of the week had its ups and downs as grief came in waves.  I recall the weirdest feeling of not believing it was true or forgetting that it had happened for a moment only for my brain to remind me that it, indeed, had happened and that J is no longer with us.  It's not that I was being insensitive or not acknowledging his passing, but my brain was really struggling to grapple with that fact that another human being I knew is no longer living because of suicide.  Just a few days before hearing about this, I had posted on my Bluesky profile about the importance Men's Mental Health.

It was not really that death that rattled me so much as it was the mental health issues.  We knew J had some problems with loneliness and was a bit socially awkward, but I don't think any of us really thought it was this bad.  It's not uncommon for folks to mask how they really feel, after all.  It was very difficult for me to not think about how I was in a similar situation back in 2012/13 and more recently in 2019/20/21.  Being able to relate so much, and on such a visceral-feeling level, had me internalizing his own feelings in the last moments.  Well, what I assume was going through his mind anyway.  I could feel his pain because I had felt it before and I broke down.  Everything came crashing back to me, but through his eyes in a strange way.  I've struggled with depression since, fuck I don't know, middle school?  This is not the entry to go into that topic, but suffice it to say that this shook me.
## Pup Night
It was finally Saturday and the work day was winding down.  I had everything laid out for the pup night at a gay bar up in Charlotte,
