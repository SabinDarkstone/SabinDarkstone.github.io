> [!QUOTE] Prompt: Who is someone that can always make you laugh out loud?

So many of the times I've truly laughed a lot were because of either my Mom or Liz. The two of them have the ability to "tip over my giggle box" as Liz calls it.

Almost weekly, Liz and I will lose control laughing because of some random thing we said. It's mostly about something absurdly silly or a reference to something previously laughed at.
