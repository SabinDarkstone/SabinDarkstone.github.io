Here's part two of how this week has been an emotionally draining one.  I've got a bottle full of ice cold water, a fan pointed at my face, and the air conditioning on to combat this ridiculous heat outside while I'm here writing on the treadmill.
### Wedding Discussion
I had texted my Mom about what happened with my pup (obviously I just used his name instead of outing all of us) earlier in the morning.  Part way through the drive back home from Charlotte, we got a phone call from her.  It's not too unusual for my partner and I to chat with my Mom on the phone together, so we answered the call.
