Here's part two of how this week has been an emotionally draining one.  I've got a bottle full of ice cold water, a fan pointed at my face, and the air conditioning on to combat this ridiculous heat outside while I'm here writing on the treadmill.  I really hope this one is shorter than [[2025-07-26|Part One]] from yesterday.
### Call from Mom
I had texted my Mom about what happened with my pup (obviously I just used his name instead of outing all of us) earlier in the morning.  Part way through the drive back home from Charlotte, we got a phone call from her.  It's not too unusual for my partner and I to chat with my Mom on the phone together, so we answered the call.  It started out innocently enough with us discussing what happened to my pup and how things are going with her.
#### Wedding Conversation
Things got a bit more interesting when the topic of the wedding came up.  Again, it started off innocently about us telling her about the wedding venue we are leaning towards, but things got weird after that.

The conversation from start to finish was about 45 minutes, so I'm not going to go into every single moment of it.  However, my partner and I gave each other some weird looks when she started questioning our decision about having a pasta bar as the meal at the reception.  For a little bit of context, my partner and I absolutely love making fresh homemade pasta from scratch.  We almost never use "box pasta" as we call it these days and we even make our own pasta sauce from scratch.  We enjoy making the pasta, cooking it, and eating it because it's something special to us: it's sort of a passion we both share.  We've modified our recipe over time to include whole wheat flour and super veggie green powder to make it even healthier for us.  We've been talking about a pasta bar basically from the beginning (so for months at this point) and we plan on including choices for red and white sauce as well as chicken a few different ways.  I hope it's pretty clear that the complaints about the pasta bar idea from my Mom really came out of left field for us.

In short, my Mom was calling it "cheap" and did not feel like it would really be honoring our wedding guests to serve them, as she put it, "spaghetti and meatballs".  To be very clear, we're not trying to be cheap, we're trying to make this reception dinner about something we are very passionate about.  To be told that it was cheap and that it needed to be elevated because it wasn't good enough for her really stung.  My partner and I sat there in stunned silence for a bit as she talked about how she disapproved of our decision and how she would rather it be something fancier.
#### That Poor Camel's Back
