I'm taking a short break from work today to do a short journal entry while on the treadmill.  The last two days have been WILD with about 22 billable hours of work on Monday and Tuesday combined.  So here we are around midday with a new entry!

> [!QUOTE] Prompt: What's something you usually enjoy?

This is a deceptively tricky question for me to answer because what I enjoy changes based on the kind of day I've had, what I've been doing lately, and what the my partner or friends are doing.  The question asks "usually", so I suppose none of that really does matter, huh?  I'm still having a hard time thinking about this one, though.

Let me take a short detour to discuss why I think this is tricky for me.  Trust me, this will all make sense (I hope).  People sometimes ask what your goal in life is; this is another question that I struggle with.  It also calls back to an earlier journal entry (not included here yet) about my purpose in life.  I don't really have any sort of grand plan or large overarching goal for me life other than to be happy each day; take care of myself, my partner, and my chosen family; and to plan for the future with a solid retirement investment.  A lot of what I do is tied up in the work I do, and I know it's starting to sound like I'm a workaholic, but I promise I'm not.
