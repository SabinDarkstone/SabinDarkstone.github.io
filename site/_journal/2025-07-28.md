I don't expect this to be too detailed, but I did feel like writing down some thoughts about generative AI as it exists today and how it is being used throughout the world.

*Note: I use relative dates which are not at all meant to be a strict timeline of events.  Don't @ me if I get a year or timespan wrong.  This is merely to paint a picture of the AI landscape.*
### Improvements
Regardless of your thoughts on gen AI, it's hard to admit that it hasn't seen a huge boom in progress and improvements over the past few years.  I remember when I first hear of GPT-2 and how it was a funny little thing that a research group was working on.  It wasn't really that useful and gave responses that were just barely reasonable in some areas.  I remember one example from a [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) coding challenge video where he used it to try to explain something about "why rocks float".  It gave a technically reasonable answer, if you ignore reality "rocks float because they are lighter than air".  I mean, if that were true, it would be technically correct.  So at this point, it was a cute tool to be silly with.

Fast forward to last year and ChatGPT was really taking off all over the place.  The AI boom was in full swing and companies were starting to take more and more interest in it.  Development in AI skyrocketed and we had GPT-3 and early GPT-4 which could do very reasonable impressions of human speech.  Things, somehow, have continued to accelerate and improve to the point where AI art is impressive and deep fakes are scarily accurate.
### How I Use Gen AI
Yes, I do use gen AI for some things in my day to day life, and even at work.  It's the kind of thing that really is more of a tool like intellisense giving me autocomplete suggestions or helping me write large swaths of boilerplate code for mundane tasks.  I find it to be just good enough to handle the simple tasks and to generate example code that I pick apart, put back together, and of course error check it.  Funny enough, I've learned a lot about stuff I used to have no knowledge about: like jekyll and ruby.  I'll be the first to admit that I know just enough to be dangerous, but isn't that how we all start out?  I'm certainly not here claiming that I'm an expert and that I vibe coded by way through my job and this site.

Now, do I advocate that students use gen AI to pass all their software dev classes? Fuck, no.  Let's me
