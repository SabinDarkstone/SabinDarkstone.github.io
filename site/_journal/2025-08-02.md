### Mint, My Beloved
Mint was a great budgeting app and did pretty much every I'd ever want it to do, and then some: it was even one of the few apps that would connect to the Apple Card to pull transactions automatically.  You can ask my partner, it was a very sad day in the house when I found out Intuit was sunsetting Mint.  I looked for alternatives that were within a similar price range with a similar look and feel, but just could not find anything that had what I was looking for.  I'd say this was more of a "me problem" than something that was inherently wrong with any of the apps.  At the time, my partner was using YNAB, and I gave that a try, too.  Again, it just didn't have the right flow I wanted.

Well, if I'm anything, I can be very stubborn and set in my ways sometimes.  *I wanted a budgeting app and I wanted it MY way, dammit!*  While I was searching for an app to use, my partner and I had been joking about me making my own.  This was a pretty big project to take on and not something I could get a third of quarter of the way through and toss aside like my other pile of incomplete side projects.  I'd, *gasp*, have to follow through.  Telling that to someone with ADHD and depression will get you laughed at.
### The First Steps
Okay, so eventually I sat down and took my experience from work and my own knowledge of .Net C# to put together an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to map out what and how I'd need to store in a database.  I used Visual Studio to scaffold pages for bank accounts, merchants, categories, and transactions.  Before I knew it, I had a working prototype that would allow me to do basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on these entities.  Seeing this progress gave me enough energy to do the next part: budgets.
### Conquering the First Hurdle
I needed to be able to track spending my category and roll up child category spending in the parent category to display this on a page.  This page needed to show each category that I want to track spending for, and it would need to visually indicate how much money is left for that category in the budgeted time span.  Well, I'm not a creative guy when it comes to UI/UX, so I wholesale ripped the design from Mint for the most part.  It turns out that progress bars are great for this sort of thing.

There was a significant amount of data juggling to aggregate all this information as well as any spending that was not allocated in the budget.  With enough effort, I was able to get this done and damn was I happy with it.  So now we had an MVP that I could host on a little raspberry pi.  I then learned about how to set up a domain, do DNS magic to point the domain to my raspberry pi, and lock things down.  I even wrote some code that would let me take a CSV export from Mint and load it into my web app.  That was used all of one time and I think the code is still sitting out there doing nothing, but data loading is a key part to any go-live.
### Improvements
As the days went on, I gradually polished to the web app and added new features like budget rollover to carry unspent money from one month to the next (or to carry overspending into the next month).  I'm particularly proud of this one because of how cleanly it displays in the budget.

At my partner's request, I added the ability to track different savings goals: a feature from YNAB that she required to fully move over to what was now dubbed K9 Koinz (codename K2, which ended up being confusing because of the 2 and the 9, but I digress).  So I added the ability to create transfers (linked paired transactions) and savings goals to allocate money to.  You could even pull money from savings goals and not have it impact the budget since that was money you explicitly saved previously.

Other features like splitting transactions came next: you could go to Walmart and get a bunch of different stuff that all did not fit in a single category.  For example, we can buy groceries, pet supplies, and cleaning products in one transaction according to the bank.  Well, this messed with the budget a bit, so now you can separate a transaction into multiple splits that hit the budget with their respective amounts.  I also added the idea of bills: expenses that you don't want to show up as lines in the budget, but still need to be tracked and as a fast follow I added scheduling transfers and bills to happen automatically.

And that was about it for the original vers
