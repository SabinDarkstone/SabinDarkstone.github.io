description: It's hard to say how much harm my parents did with all their snooping, but I know for sure that it definitely did not too much good.

It's been a few days since my last entry, and that's mostly due to the fact I've been working on the site and doing a small overhaul of some significant parts.  For some reason, my mind is not too into the idea of doing development work on the site AND journal entries in the same timespan.  It's kind of weird, but also an interesting observation, I suppose.  In other news: it's a very slow and not at all mentally engaging Monday at work, so I decided to take a break to do this.

Finally, I conquer one of my story ideas on the Welcome page of my online journal.  These are all rather daunting to even think about writing, let alone actually sitting down and doing it.  But I did have someone mention they were interested in reading about this topic and I don't have any ideas of topics today, so it all works out, doesn't it?

I'm not sure how many other parents snooped and invaded the privacy of their kids, but I can't imagine it's all that uncommon.  It being somewhat common certainly does not make it any less frustrating and impactful on my later life.  Now I know what you're thinking: how could Sabin's parents snooping around and finding stuff have an impact on his adult life?  If you are thinking that: then buckle up for what I expect to be a long journal entry.  I suppose if, for some reason, you aren't thinking that you can just stop reading now and save yourself some time.

It all started when I was...you know, I don't actually remember how old I was.  I guess I was just on the edge of hitting puberty though, given some of the context clues when thinking back.  The first time I remember my parents snooping around "my stuff" was around the same time I started taking an interest in hockey gear.  I could probably write an entire entry about how I got into sports gear, but those are traumatic consequences for another time, I'm sure.  Suffice it to say that I had the guts to sneak downstairs at night and grab some pieces of my ice hockey gear when I was a kid and sneak them back into my bedroom with me.  As far as I knew at the time, I just liked how the pieces of gear felt against me.  I don't think I could specifically explain why in ways that I can today, but that didn't matter at the time because I was an impulsive pre-teen with ADHD.  I was able to get away with this for a while, but like all other good things, this came to an end.

It did not take long for my parents to realize what was going on and to this day I'm not quite sure what it was that tipped them off.  I thought I was being pretty sneaky, after all.  Regardless, this was the first instance I remember of my parents snooping around because one evening when I went to retrieve some pieces of gear from my hiding place, I realized they were gone.  Boy, was I bummed out about this and kind of upset, too: it just didn't seem fair and it didn't make since to me.  My brain pieced together that if the gear was taken away, then that must mean what I was doing was wrong.  Unfortunately, this was something that was only reinforced as I grew up and continued to do this into my teenage years.

I continued to sneak pieces of my hockey gear up to my room over the next few years and without my parents saying much to me.  Eventually, I even stopped playing hockey but continued to enjoy how the gear felt against my body.  This was when things got bad, though.  My parents were not sure how to handle this, I'm assume, and did what they probably thought was best.  They didn't want me to grow up abnormal, or at least that was my best guess. One day, my mom came to confront me about this and told me that I was "too young for sex acts" and really instilled in me that what I was doing was weird and wrong.  I wish I could remember my exact age, but I was probably 14 or 15?  And yeah I guess she may have been technically right based on a Christian upbringing, but that's not logic that I cared about.

The game continued, however, as I found where my parents would stash the gear time and time again.  I didn't like that I was being told something was wrong when I was never told why it was wrong.  In fact, I was never given any sort of explanation about anything related to what I now know as a gear fetish.  I wasn't stupid though, I had of course figured out why I liked certain pieces of sports gear.  And then there was the sexual pleasure aspect of it, and I now assume this is what my parents were really not okay with.  The thing is, I don't think they had any proof of thing piece of the puzzle.  Then again, it's possible I don't give them enough credit.  Regardless, it was their disapproval and the act of denying me any sort of explanation that really sunk in and still affects me today.  I still fight this intense shame of my gear fetish as there is still a part of me that thinks it is wrong and weird.
