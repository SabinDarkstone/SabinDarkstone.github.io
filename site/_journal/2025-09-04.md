[Fragments](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zflDhdE9Y75Gv8V8NNpLY)

At the end of every year, Spotify does their thing where you see your year of music in review. I'm expecting to see a couple of songs with a high play count, but nothing will come even close to "Fragments" by The Stupendium. And honestly, I just have to compliment this man on his creativity and talent. There are a number of songs about video games that I've really enjoyed listening to on repeat, but Fragments has to be at the top based on how much I connected with the lyrics.

If you aren't familiar with the game Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, let me give you a small overview of it.

> When realities collide, it's appealing to think
> There's green on the other side, well, you're wielding the Sprinkler



> The world's what you make of it, you're fate's not engrained
> Every crack in the paint it still a piece of the picture
