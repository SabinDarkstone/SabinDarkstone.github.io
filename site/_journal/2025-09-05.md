[Fragments](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zflDhdE9Y75Gv8V8NNpLY)

At the end of every year, Spotify does their thing where you see your year of music in review. I'm expecting to see a couple of songs with a high play count, but nothing will come even close to "Fragments" by The Stupendium. And honestly, I just have to compliment this man on his creativity and talent. There are a number of songs about video games that I've really enjoyed listening to on repeat, but Fragments has to be at the top based on how much I connected with the lyrics.

If you aren't familiar with the game Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, let me give you a small overview of it.  The Ratchet & Clank series itself is a series of 3D action platformers starting in the PS2 era of games alongside the other great series of Jak & Daxter and Sly Cooper.  R&C features the adventures of a Lombax named Ratchet and a small robot sidekick named Clank.  I won't go into plotlines of all the games as much as I would love to gush about the series, but suffice it to say that the duo regularly saves the galaxy many times over throughout the 6 main story games (3 on the PS2 and 3 on the PS3).  There are other games from different studios, but for the longest time those were the main games until Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart came out.

Rift Apart was special because it featured a second Lombax playable character in an alternate dimension named Rivet.  The names Ratchet and Rivet fit well together due to the ever-present machine and vehicle tinkering nature of Lombaxes according to their historical lore.  These two Lombaxes were both the last of their kind in their respective dimensions and only discovered each other when Dr. Nefarious stole a device called the Dimensionator from Ratchet and Clank.  The story of the game proceeds to switch between playing as the two Lombaxes to stop evil and save their respective dimensions from disaster all while battling various interpersonal struggles.  It's an incredibly fun game that is true to form of the original 3 PS2 games and the follow up Future series on the PS3.  I highly recommend playing it.

> [!NOTE] 
The song I want to talk about and analyze, just like the other songs from the Stupendium, features a lot of references to the video game.  I'll try to include the relevant details when necessary are footers.

The overall vibe of the song, to me anyway, is about the duality of your life.  One one hand, you are dealt a hand and you have the make the best of what you are given.  However, we have the ability to do more than that and we can make our own life what we want it to be, to a certain extent.  There are certain things we can't do much about and in those situations we have to make the best of it.  I'm going to pull lines of lyrics from the song to write about them and provide my own insight about how I feel they apply to my life so far.

### The Rug
The first part of the first verse is a chunky one to quote, but talks about how you can go from feeling like you've got your life figured out and everything is going smoothly to having rug pulled out from under your feet.  All of a sudden, this life doesn't feel like what you were used to and you have a whole set of new challenges to deal with because of a single (or many) events that occurred

> You've been living as the main event
> Live a life on red carpets
> You can't be surprised when you ask where the rug went
> When it's pulled out from under your feet

It's hard to deal with such a drastic change and it is especially hard when that is compounded with a new environment.  I attended Marquette University for my first year of college.  This was a very new situation for me: being far from home and living on my own for the first time were the two biggest challenges.  Other things arose after I completed my first semester and started my second semester as a Freshman.  Partway through, I feel into a really deep and dark depression where I felt utterly hopeless.  I kept to myself and stayed secluded in my dorm room.  In the beginning of this, I would still go to some classes, but eventually I stopped going to classes all together.  I started to have thoughts of suicide as time went on because I felt like I just didn't belong and I didn't have anyone to reach out to.  Finally, I had a moment of huge panic that piled onto the depression when I had a final paper due in my English Composition class that I had not even started on.  That's when I broke down and called my parents because I simply couldn't handle everything at once.

### Loose Screws
Taking a short intermission from that story, I want to cover these couple of lines because they make me laugh a bit.  We all have weird families and weird things about ourselves that we get from them either genetically or through the ways we were raised.

> Don't get to choose the loose screws you inherit.
> (That's more than a face in the mirror you're seeing)

Stepping back, however, we all have loose screws that are with us in a less literal sense of inheriting from our parents or family.  Ultimately, we are who we are and there's not a lot we can do about that at a core identity level.  We can discover new parts of ourselves over time to reveal those "loose screws", and we can even change who we are at a surface level.  At the end of the day, though, we are who we are and that's what makes each of us special: there's more to us than we are show to the world.

### Tools to Repair It
I didn't actually realize until I'm writing this how much of a damn play-by-play this seems to be of my life, *fuck*.

>Together you've got the tools to repair it
>Might just be a Lombax with a wrench
>I was sat on the bench, now I'm back with a vengeance

Back to story time: I took a medical withdraw and started an outpatient partial hospitalization program that went on for about 7 or 8 months of daily group therapy sessions and individualized cognitive behavioral therapy.  I'm not going to say it was easy, but I got through it and came out the other side with a new balance of medications and coping mechanisms to work through future problems.  This is when I took a job at Target while taking a break from school.

I wasn't alone at this point, I had people helping me through this and, to abuse the metaphor, I had the tools to repair it (myself) at least as best as I could.  Things improved for a while before I started some community college.  I had ups and downs there with this same depression hitting me for a second wave.  I stopped going to classes and ended up having to take withdraws again due to my poor grades.  At this point I pretty humiliated and felt like I was never going to get myself back up again.
