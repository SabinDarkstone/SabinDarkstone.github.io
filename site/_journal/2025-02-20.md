It's hard not to smile when I see all these pictures. I can't believe how lucky I am to have Liz in my life because it truly is so much better with her. I could have gotten along fine without her if that's how things turned out, but I'm really glad we ended up together.

I sometimes find myself thinking about why we are together and I always come back to how well we truly get along on so many levels. We just click perfectly in so many ways.

I love you, Liz.

> [!QUOTE] Prompt: What's your best quality? Do others know this about you?

I think my best quality is my empathy and compassionate nature. In a lot of situations, I try to put myself in the other person's shoes to understand where they are coming from. A lot of my work involves people that are being pressured by higher ups or who are facing other pressure. Before getting fed up with them or taking something personally, I try to understand what's going on in their work life and use that as a point of reference.

I think others tend to know this about me if they take a few moments to get to know me.
